# Steller-Motion-tracking
This project uses MATLAB to show how a star appears to move across the sky over time. Plug in the star’s coordinates and your location, and the script calculates and plots its path. It’s an easy way to explore basic astronomy concepts and practice with MATLAB’s plotting tools.
